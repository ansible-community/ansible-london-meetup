              We started using ansible actively in my team toward the end of 2017 beginning of 2018.
              We are now answering questions on what is our standards around creating new ansible modules and playbooks,
              how do we test in a sensible and sustainable way.
              It would be interesting to share our story and what we would do differently if we started over this again.
