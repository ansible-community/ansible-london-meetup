              G-Research use Ansible to automate infrastructure and perform orchestration
              tasks. I will be talking about the various technologies that we automate
              with Ansible and the different ways we run our playbooks.

              Growth Intelligence is building a platform to help businesses grow faster
              and connect to their customers using AI. We deploy machine learning models
              into a web app backed by data on millions of UK businesses. In this talk,
              I will talk about how we also use Ansible to deploy the data our machine
              learning models rely on and describe how we use Ansible roles and playbooks
              to snapshot/restore Elasticsearch indices into our staging and prod environments.

            abstract: |
              For nearly 5 years I've been installing software and setting up dotfiles on my
              Macbook with Ansible. It has saved me a bunch of time - first in synchronizing
              between home and work laptops, and second when they have to get wiped! I'll
              walk through how it works and hopefully inspire the audience to use Ansible for
              automating their personal IT too.
