      presentation:
        by: Jiri Tyr
        document: [Ansible Inventory Plugins](Ansible Inventory Plugins.pdf)
        abstract: |
          In one of the past meetups, we have learned how to create a Dynamic
          Inventory Script. Ansible has evolved since and scripts were replaced
          by plugins. This talk will explore the differences between the
          Dynamic Inventory Script and the Inventory Plugin and will show how
          to write your own Inventory Plugin.
