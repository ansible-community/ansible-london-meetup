            John recently wrote a book about Ansible (The Tao of Ansible) where he describes in simple words the philosophy
            around the tool while he teaches the reader the basics to get started.
            He will take the opportunity to reach an even bigger audience, explain the reasons for writing such a book,
            and why he believe on the simplicity of the tool too.
